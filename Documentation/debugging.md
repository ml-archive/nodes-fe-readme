# Debugging

## React JS

To debug React JS, we use these two Chrome extensions:

- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)

## React Native

For debugging react native apps in iOS or Android, we use the following tool, as as it comes as a standalone app for macOS. It is based on official debugger of React Native, and includes React Inspector / Redux DevTools.
